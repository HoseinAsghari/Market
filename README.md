1-part:\
  we made some classes and their attributes and methodes as you can see in the "ap-project-phase0-99107838pdf".\
2-part:\
 we made some user cases and use cases as an objects and some descriptions corresponding.and you can see in the "ap-project-phase1-99107838.pdf"\

\4-part:\
   then we made a sequence diagram . because of that edrawmax do not have User interface Shape we could not implement it . and you can see in the "ap-project-phase2-99107838.pdf"\

\
\and finally we used Java to implements our Projects:\
\
at first let take look at what do we have in our src dolder:\
App.java:\
it is our main class and only and only this class has main method . so it is the gate of our application. it means if we want to tun this we must at first run App.java\
